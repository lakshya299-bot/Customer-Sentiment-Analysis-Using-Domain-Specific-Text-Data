## 🔍 Overview
This project reframes **sentiment analysis** as a **customer insight and feedback understanding** problem rather than a simple text classification task.

Instead of relying solely on generic pretrained language models, the system adapts transformer representations to the **movie-review domain**, enabling it to capture:
- Domain-specific vocabulary usage  
- Subtle sentiment cues such as sarcasm and irony  
- Contextual sentiment shifts in long-form customer feedback  

An **end-to-end NLP pipeline** was developed and deployed in a **production-like environment** using Docker and Azure App Service.

## 🎯 Problem Motivation
Generic pretrained transformers often underperform on domain-specific customer feedback due to:
- Vocabulary mismatch between pretraining corpora and review text  
- Over-reliance on surface-level sentiment keywords  
- Difficulty handling mixed or delayed sentiment expression  

This project investigates whether **domain-adaptive pretraining using Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** improves downstream sentiment classification reliability.

## 📂 Dataset
### Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0 (IMDB)

**Key Characteristics**
- **50,000 labeled reviews**
  - 25,000 training  
  - 25,000 testing  
  - Balanced polarity (positive / negative)
- **50,000 unlabeled reviews** used for unsupervised pretraining  
- Train and test splits contain **disjoint movies** (prevents data leakage)
- Maximum **30 reviews per movie** to reduce correlation bias  

**Label Definition**
- Positive → Rating ≥ 7  
- Negative → Rating ≤ 4  
- Neutral reviews excluded from supervised splits
