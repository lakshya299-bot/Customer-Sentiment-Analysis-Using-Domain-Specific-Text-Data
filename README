🎬 Customer Sentiment Analysis
Domain-Adaptive Transformer Models for Feedback Understanding

🔍 Overview

This project reframes sentiment analysis as a customer insight and feedback understanding problem rather than a simple text classification task.

Instead of relying solely on generic pretrained language models, the system adapts transformer representations to the movie-review domain, capturing:

Domain-specific vocabulary usage

Subtle sentiment cues (sarcasm, irony)

Contextual sentiment shifts in long-form feedback

An end-to-end NLP pipeline was developed and deployed in a production-like environment using Docker and Azure App Service.

🎯 Problem Motivation

Generic pretrained transformers often underperform on domain-specific customer feedback due to:

Vocabulary mismatch

Over-reliance on surface-level sentiment words

Poor handling of mixed or delayed sentiment expression

This project evaluates whether domain-adaptive pretraining (MLM) improves downstream sentiment classification reliability.
