# IMDB Sentiment Analysis for Customer Insight & Feedback Understanding  
*Domain-Adaptive Transformer Models*

## Overview
This project frames sentiment analysis as a **customer insight and feedback understanding problem**, aiming to capture **domain-specific sentiment patterns** present in movie reviews rather than relying solely on generic language models.

An end-to-end NLP pipeline was built using transformer architectures, combining:
- Exploratory analysis of large-scale unlabeled text  
- Domain-adaptive pretraining using Masked Language Modeling (MLM)  
- Supervised fine-tuning for binary sentiment classification  

The system was evaluated across multiple transformer variants and deployed in a **production-like environment using Docker on Azure App Service (Linux)**.

## Problem Motivation
Generic pretrained language models often fail to capture:
- Domain-specific vocabulary usage  
- Subtle sentiment cues such as sarcasm and irony  
- Contextual sentiment shifts common in long-form customer feedback  

This project investigates whether adapting transformer representations to the movie-review domain improves sentiment classification reliability for downstream customer insight tasks.

## Dataset  
### Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0 (IMDB)

**Core characteristics:**
- **50,000 labeled reviews**
  - 25,000 training  
  - 25,000 testing  
  - Balanced polarity (25k positive, 25k negative)  
- **50,000 unlabeled reviews** for unsupervised learning  
- Train and test splits contain **disjoint movies**, preventing data leakage  
- Maximum of **30 reviews per movie** to reduce correlation bias  

**Label definition:**
- Positive: rating ≥ 7  
- Negative: rating ≤ 4  
- Neutral reviews excluded from supervised splits
